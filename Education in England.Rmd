## Introduction

This is the 2024 week 4 exercise from TidyTuesday [@tidytuesday]. The dataset comes from The UK Office for National Statistics. It was explored in the article "Why children and young people in smaller towns do better academically than those in larger towns?" [@howstudentsdo] The article considers pupils who sat their GCSEs in 2012 and 2013, and followed up their progress in universities. The conclusion is that pupils from smaller towns perform better academically than their counterparts from larger cities. Also, pupils from towns with low level income deprivation did better than the towns with high level income deprivation.
